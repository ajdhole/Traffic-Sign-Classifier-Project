My submission for P-2 Udacity **Self Driving Car Nanodegree**

 
Self Driving Cars will have to recognize traffic signs and then obey the same. In this project we use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs.

In this project we build a traffic sign classifier using a Deep Learning. Steps include: 
1. normalizing image data 
2. balancing the data set 
3. building and training a convolutional neural network with a traffic sign dataset 
4. tweaking the initializations, hyper parameters, fully connected layer sizes, the CNN filter sizes to increase the accuracy of the system 
5. testing the accuracy of the system with images found on the internet
